# one-page

Just want one stupid page? Use this!

We depend on:

 - `node-sass` for compiling scss to css
 - `live-server` for watching and reloading

## Get started

Click the button,

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/nqthqn/one-page)

This will prompt you to create a new repo with these files in it and it will deploy the site. Then you can work in your seperate repo. Clone your new repo and run `npm i` and `npm start`. Start editing your scss and html files and watch the browser reload your changes automagically. When you are satisfied, commit everything and push. Netlify should detect the changes and redeploy.
