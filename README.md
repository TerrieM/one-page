# one-page

Just want one stupid page? Use this!

We depend on:

 - `node-sass` for compiling scss to css
 - `live-server` for watching and reloading

That's it!

## Get started

Download the zip or clone me. Run `npm i` and `npm start`. Start editing your scss and html and watch the browser reload your changes automagically.
